EDA Workflow

Loading Data:
Load the dataset and perform a preliminary overview (shape, types, missing values, etc.).

Data Cleaning:
Handle missing data and outliers.

Descriptive Statistics:
Explore distributions, central tendency, and variability.

Visualizations:
Histograms for feature distributions.
Scatter plots for feature relationships.
Heatmaps for correlation between features.
Box plots to detect outliers.

Feature Engineering:
Creation of new features (if any) based on existing data.

Future Work
Model building based on the insights from the EDA.
Feature selection and optimization.
Hyperparameter tuning for better model performance.
